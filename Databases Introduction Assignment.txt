> Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: Databases are great to deal with (CRUD - create, read, update, delete) persistent data (that remains after the program ends) that can be accessed and altered by more than one instance. Text files are used more for your code and your resources - things you wouldn't want a bunch of people accessing and changing. This is also persistent data, but you wouldn't want to be constantly having to save information here, you'd want to use a database. 


> Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: SQL is declarative rather than procedural. With a procedural language, you actually have to figure out WHAT to do, step by step. So if you want data, you have the to tell it HOW to get the data. With declarative, you declare what you want, but not how to get it. 

> In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A: Databases store data in binary files (a format not readable by people), and have an interface that allows people to manage the data by using the language, SQL (and others). The database itself is a table (like Excel). So that means it has columns and rows. Rows would be for each item. If you have a table of cats for adoption, the rows would be made up of all the data pertaining to each individual cat. The columns contain data about each unit (cat in this case). So if you have Fluffy in row number 1 and Shadow in row 2, the columns would be made up of different information you want to have about all the different cats (ages, vaccines, physical descriptions, etc). These can all be different data types (age as an integer, descriptions as a string, etc). So the first row has all the information about Fluffy, but the columns tell you the different types of information you'll have for all the cats. Where a row and column intersect you have a cell, which contains a value. So for row Fluffy, and column age (in years), the cell would contain the integer 2 because Fluffy is 2 years old.  

> Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A: The database itself is a table (like Excel). So that means it has columns and rows. Rows would be for each item. If you have a table of cats for adoption, the rows would be made up of all the data pertaining to each individual cat. The columns contain data about each unit (cat in this case).

Where a row and column intersect you have a cell, which contains a value. So for row Fluffy, and column age (in years), the cell would contain the integer 2 because Fluffy is 2 years old.  
Rows go horizontally across the table and contain each item about which you have information, columns vertically (and they have headers to tell you what sort of information will go in each column), and values are what is entered into each individual cell. 

> List three data types that can be used in a table.

A: String, integer, object. 

> Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

```
     SELECT date, amount
     FROM payments;

     SELECT amount
     FROM payments
     WHERE amount > 500;

     SELECT *
     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';
```

A: 

```
Return all of the dates and all of the amounts from the payments table. 
date	amount
2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	1500.0000
2016-05-10T00:00:00.000Z	37.0000
2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z	124.9300
2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	54.7200
```

```

date	payee	amount	memo
2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z	Mega Foods	124.9300	Groceries
```

> Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

- The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.
